Blender Add-on to eliminate two annoying tasks for avatar creators

This installs two buttons on the material panel:

-Option to turn off Show Backface for alpha materials on all selected objects, eliminating the need to go through every single material and check that option off

-Option to rename first UVMap for all selected objects to the blender standard "UVMap", quickly correcting misnamed UV maps that would otherwise cause problems when merging meshes
